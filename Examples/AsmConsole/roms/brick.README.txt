; Brick Out by Blake Ramsdell <blaker@gmail.com> http://www.blakeramsdell.com

; A poor attempt at brick out with no player involved. Maybe someday I'll
; let you play it, or you can view this as an exercise for the reader to put
; in a paddle that is user-controlled.

; I guess this is Copyright (C) 2007 Blake Ramsdell, and you have a license to
; do whatever you want with it, just tell me what you did and give me a
; mention. If you want to sell it, and you make a billion dollars, then good
; for you. You might at least throw a party and invite me.

; The gist of it is pretty simple -- you have a ball, and the ball has an X
; and a Y velocity. When it hits something, it bounces off of it. If the thing
; that it hits is not a wall, then it erases it. Pretty dead-simple behavior.

; I don't like the vertical movement -- there's a shortcut in here somewhere
; to make it less computationally expensive I think. Right now it just does a
; two byte add and subtract of $20.

; The ball motion is also a bit weird looking. I don't know if this is an
; artifact of the simulation environment combined with a normal tearing
; artifact related to refresh or what.
